=head2 Major Contributors

The following list are contributors to Bio::Moose specifically.

Of course, Bio::Moose would not be possible without BioPerl itself. The modules
here are primarily refactored from their BioPerl equivalents for Moose. Where
applicable, we are acknowledging the original module authors in the POD
documentation unless the module has undergone a complete reimplementation.

(Feel free to add descriptions of which modules you are responsible for if you
see fit)
