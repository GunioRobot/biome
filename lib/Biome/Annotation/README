Annotation and Annotation Collections

This system is mainly inherited from BioPerl. It long been suggested that this
could easily be replaced by something with a hierarchal structure using a
predefined schema, along the lines of XML, JSON, or even using an Ontology. This
would possibly involve something along the lines of Data::Stag, XML::LibXML,
JSON, or maybe a pluggable system that allows any of the above.

It is very possible this system will be overhauled with that in mind, with an
eye towards keeping a lightweight implementation with easy serialization.
