Annotation and Annotation Collections

This system is mainly inherited from BioPerl.  Several users and devs
have previously indicated that this could easily be replaced by something
that creates a hierarchal structure with a predefined schema, along the lines
of XML, JSON, or even using an Ontology.

It is very possible this system will be overhauled with that in mind, with an
eye towards a lightweight implementation with easy serialization.
